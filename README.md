# Game
C++ implementation of the game 7 Wonders

# Objective
This implementation will be used for testing data mining and bots.

# Compilation
Create a build subdir on the project root, then run cmake
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. [ -GNinja ]
make [or ninja]
```
 on the project build subdir, and you'll end up with a "7Wonders" binary file.


# ToDo
